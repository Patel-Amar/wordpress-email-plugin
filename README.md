# wordpress-email-plugin

Integrates ysers from wp-event-manager and restrict-content-pro (other wordpress plugins) to create an emailing system. Emailing groups are automatically created from different events and membership levels created from the two plugins respectively. Users can then select multiple groups and send out emails using a rich text editor that is built into the plugin.

Emails that were sent out are archived in an other menu tab in Wordpress and administrators can track which users have read the email and which users haven't.
